    <h3>Minestorm:
        <a href="https://www.coleka.com/en/video-games/vectrex/mine-storm-ii_i57653" target="_blank"><img src="images/minestorm.jpg" alt="Minestorm" class="games" class="border"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>Minestorm, the most popular game on the vectrex was published in 1982 by general consumer’s electronics (GCE). With many comparisons this built-in game was very much like Asteroids from the Atari only a lot more fun. The game was very simple yet very entertaining. You start your space adventure on level 1 surrounded by 4 huge mines which break up into two smaller ones as you shoot them, with the mines increasing and the playing area condensing this game kept you on your toes at all times.</p>

    <h3>Armor Attack:

    </h3>
    <p>Next on the list is Armor Attack, another highly remembered game which put you in a war torn city trying to survive waves of enemy tanks and helicopters. Published in 1982 on the Vectrex and 1980 for the arcades this game had not only a great soundtrack but very responsive controls, immersing many players into the game as they put countless hours into the game.</p>

    <h3>Berzerk:

    </h3> 
    <p>1982 saw the release of Berzerk, a single player maze game. This game unique as it was a maze game but it was also the first game that had speech synthesis costing nearly a $1000 a word. Created by GCE Berzerk had many around the nation trying to escape while taking down all the robots while being on a time limit which released the indestructible evil Otto nemesis. As many of you agree if you was a fan of mazes this was your childhood.</p>

    </h3>
    <p>Last but not least is pole position. Racing games have always part of the gaming industry many of us grew up playing them and we still can’t get enough. Originally created in 1982 but later ported to a wide range of consoles including the vectrex in 1983. The single player game had players racing around a course dodging hazards while trying to out manoeuvre your opponents and not hit them at the same time. Players where given 90 seconds to finish the lap giving you an extra 60 seconds each time you cross the line, players must complete four laps to claim victory.</p>

        <h3>3D Crazy Coaster:

    </h3>
    <p>Ever wished to have your own roller coaster? Many of us where given that chance in 1983 with the release of Crazy coaster. The goal of the game was to keep the passengers hands raised throughout the ride, the faster you go the more points you received. Although it was time consuming the game was well anticipated, it was all we spoke about, and the arcade feeling it gave off made it even more relaxing.</p>
