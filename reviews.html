    <p class="italic">"Simply the coolest, most unique classic console ever made! You won't see Vector Graphics on a home console anywhere else, it's the one and only. Despite its release and demise in the early 80's, the Vectrex has a vibrant homebrew scene, with new software and hardware still being made for it this very day. Vector graphics never look right via emulation, so owning real hardware is the only way to roll. Long live the Vectrex!"

    <p class="italic">"Although I have played Vectrex games via emulation on a PC for years, I only recently had a chance to buy one and play these games "in the flesh". I am really stunned at how good some of the games look. If you like the look and feel of early 80s arcade games such as Asteroids, Battlezone, or Tempest, then this is the system for you. Although the graphics are vector-based "lines only" they do look sharp and crisp. The Vectrex is perfect for old-school arcade shooter games like Scramble, Solar Quest, or Armor Attack.
If you get one of these, search on Google for a "Vectrex multicart"; the original library of games was released to the public domain, so you can legally buy a multicart with the original 80s games. I've played through them all, and although some of the games haven't aged well, others are both fun to play and great to look at."</p>

    <p class="italic">"I still have my system from my childhood. The game mine storm that is included is great and addictive. I have the pen and 3d goggles. This system was way ahead of its time. All these years later it still works. If you are a gaming enthusiast get this system."</p>

    <p class="italic">"I personally love the Vectrex, and it's my favorite system to play. I must tell you though, they don't come cheap, and are pretty rare. Get one when you can, while you still can. Make sure the joystick still works: it should have a one inch chrome joy stick that re-centers itself, meaning that when you move it, say, to the left, that after you let go it will spring back to the center. I also encourage you to get a multi-cart, which is a modern cartridge containing a selection (if not all) of the games available, they usually go for around fifty to one hundred dollars.
    If you get one, try and get a multi cart, and try and get good, working controllers!
    Also: it's also great for the office, all you need to do is plug it in! And the best part is: it only takes up about one square foot of desk space!"</p>

    <p class="italic">"It's so much fun. The monitor displays only white vectors on a black background, like the original arcade Asteroids. The Vectrex is much faster and sharper than non-vector consoles of the time(1983). Vectrex is the only dedicated vector graphics console.</p>

    <p class="italic">Each original game was packaged with it's own screen "overlay", a translucent plastic card that tinted the vectors various colors, (a system not unlike many vector graphics arcade cabinets such as Battlezone and Asteroids Deluxe). The screen overlays are an essential part of the experience for me. Not all vectrex players feel this way though.</p>

    <p class="italic">Look around for pictures and videos of the Vectrex in action. I'd say that if what you see makes you want your own Vectrex, you will not be disappointed when you get one.</p>

    <p class="italic">Although the Vectrex was only manufactured for a year or so, ending production almost 30 years ago, THERE ARE STILL PEOPLE PRODUCING NEW GAMES. Some of these games are among the best on the system. The original makers of the Vectrex have given open permissions to continue this development, and have basically put the entire system into the public domain. Unlike other "dead" consoles, it is perfectly legal to emulate all original Vectrex games on your computer. So you can go right now and download a Vectrex emulator and some Vectrex roms, to test it out and see what you might like. Just bare in mind that it is much more fun on a real Vectrex.</p>

    <p class="italic">The console has a built in game, Minestorm, which is a good game. Minestorm has it's own screen overlay, which was included with the system. I would recommend buying Vectrex elsewhere, as it is quite old and you should know for sure what is included and what the condition of everything is before you decide how much to spend. Most of them out there are still working though. I love my Vectrex."</p>
