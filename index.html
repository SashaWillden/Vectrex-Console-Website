    <h3>Vectrex Console:</h3>
    <p>The Vectrex console is one of the second generation consoles that was released in 1982 that had a bootup screen in the feature system, but the console was short-lived in the entry of the home console market by General Consumer Electronics (GCE). Until this day, the generation who played it has never forgotten the console of how unique it is and the console came with an integrated vector monitor, which used plastic screen overlays to emulate colours, a built-in controller and a popular built-in game called Minestorm.</p>

    <p>In the 1980s, vector graphic video games were very popular in arcades. Those who know about the Vectrex console would most likely understand their childhood experience of the console and how expensive the console was on the release date.</p>
